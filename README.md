# Heart-Failure-Prediction

The Heart Failure Detection Project represents a vital initiative in the healthcare field,addressing the 
pressing need for early and accurate detection of heart failure, a chronic condition affecting millions 
of individuals worldwide. Heart failure places asignificant burden on healthcare systems and can
severely impact patients' quality oflife. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology, including Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANNs) and machine learning techniques, this project endeavors to provide a 
robustand reliable system for the prediction of heart failure risk. The project's scope encompasses
various essential components, starting with data collection from diversesources, such as electronic
health records, medical devices, and patient surveys. This collected data is meticulously 
preprocessed, including handling missing values and feature scaling, to ensure its suitability for 
analysis.
The heart of the project lies in model development, where ANNs and machine learning algorithms 
are employed to create a predictive model that can accurately assess the likelihood of heart failure 
in individuals. The model's performance is rigorously validated using various metrics, including
accuracy, precision, recall, andthe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. It is critical to 
ensure that the model's predictions align with the ground truth and are trustworthy for clinical
decision-making.
The project's impact extends to deployment, where the trained model is integrated into healthcare 
systems and interfaces, allowing healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive risk
predictions swiftly and seamlessly. The goal is to createa user-friendly interface that facilitates the 
use of this advanced technology by medical practitioners, ultimately enhancing the quality of care 
provided to patients. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are implemented to ensure the model's
ongoing performance and accuracy in real-world settings.
Ethical considerations are paramount throughout the project, as it involves sensitivemedical data
and has far-reaching implications for patient well-being. This encompasses data privacy, fairness 
in model predictions, and adherence to ethical guidelines, emphasizing responsible AI use in the
healthcare domain.

For this project, we took a dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
This dataset contains the medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure, collected during their follow-up period, where each patient profile has 13 clinical features.
